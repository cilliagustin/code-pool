# Testing

## Code Validation

I have used the recommended [HTML W3C Validator](https://validator.w3.org) to validate all of my HTML files. Since some of the pages requires authorisation to be accessed, some of the validation were done by checking the HTML file by entering the URL and some by copying and pasting the HTML code into the validator

| Page |  Screenshot | Type of valiation |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Index | ![screenshot](documentation/screenshots/index-html-validation.png) | Validated by URL |
| Posts | ![screenshot](documentation/screenshots/posts-html-validation.png) | Validated by URL |

**IMPORTANT**: Python/Jinja syntax in HTML

Python projects that use Jinja syntax, such as `{% for loops %}`, `{% url 'home' %}`, and `{{ variable|filter }}`
will not validate properly if you're copying/pasting into the HTML validator.

In order to properly validate these types of files, it's recommended to
[validate by uri](https://validator.w3.org/#validate_by_uri) from the deployed Heroku pages.

Unfortunately, pages that require a user to be logged-in and authenticated (CRUD functionality),
will not work using this method, due to the fact that the HTML Validator (W3C) doesn't have
access to login to your pages.
In order to properly validate HTML pages with Jinja syntax for authenticated pages, follow these steps:

- Navigate to the deployed pages which require authentication
- Right-click anywhere on the page, and select **View Page Source** (usually `CTRL+U` or `âŒ˜+U` on Mac).
- This will display the entire "compiled" code, without any Jinja syntax.
- Copy everything, and use the [validate by input](https://validator.w3.org/#validate_by_input) method.
- Repeat this process for every page that requires a user to be logged-in/authenticated.

### CSS

Result from [W3C CSS Validation Service](https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator) for style.css. The code was validated by copying and pasting the code directly to the validator:

### JavaScript

I have used the recommended [JShint Validator](https://jshint.com) to validate all of my JS files.

### Python

I have used the recommended [CI Python Linter](https://pep8ci.herokuapp.com) to validate all of my Python files.

## Responsiveness

I've tested my deployed project on multiple devices to check for responsiveness issues. The Screenshoots provided now for the desktop and mobile versions will be the same ones shown in the browser compatibility comparision since I have checked [Google Chrome](https://www.google.com/chrome) on my desktop and [Safari](https://support.apple.com/downloads/safari) on my Iphone 14. The screenshots used for the Tablet version were taken using a tablet resolution on Chrome developer tools.

## Lighthouse Audit

Use this space to discuss testing the live/deployed site's Lighthouse Audit reports.
Avoid testing the local version (especially if developing in Gitpod), as this can have knock-on effects of performance.

If you don't have Lighthouse in your Developer Tools,
it can be added as an [extension](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/lighthouse/blipmdconlkpinefehnmjammfjpmpbjk).

Don't just test the home page (unless it's a single-page application).
Make sure to test the Lighthouse Audit results for all of your pages.

**IMPORTANT**: You must provide screenshots of the results, to "prove" that you've actually tested them.

Sample Lighthouse testing documentation:

I've tested my deployed project using the Lighthouse Audit tool to check for any major issues.

| Page | Size | Screenshot | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Home | Mobile | ![screenshot](documentation/lighthouse-home-mobile.png) | Some minor warnings |
| Home | Desktop | ![screenshot](documentation/lighthouse-home-desktop.png) | Few warnings |
| About | Mobile | ![screenshot](documentation/lighthouse-about-mobile.png) | Some minor warnings |

## User Story Testing

Testing user stories is actually quite simple, once you've already got the stories defined on your README.

Most of your project's **features** should already align with the **user stories**,
so this should as simple as creating a table with the user story, matching with the re-used screenshot
from the respective feature.

| User Story | Screenshot |
| --- | --- |
| As a new site user, I would like to ____________, so that I can ____________. | ![screenshot](documentation/feature01.png) |
| As a new site user, I would like to ____________, so that I can ____________. | ![screenshot](documentation/feature02.png) |
| As a new site user, I would like to ____________, so that I can ____________. | ![screenshot](documentation/feature03.png) |
| As a returning site user, I would like to ____________, so that I can ____________. | ![screenshot](documentation/feature04.png) |
| As a returning site user, I would like to ____________, so that I can ____________. | ![screenshot](documentation/feature05.png) |

## Automated Testing

I have conducted a series of automated tests on my application.

I fully acknowledge and understand that, in a real-world scenario, an extensive set of additional tests would be more comprehensive.


### Python (Unit Testing)

I have used Django's built-in unit testing framework to test the application functionality.

In order to run the tests, I ran the following command in the terminal each time:

`python3 manage.py test name-of-app `

To create the coverage report, I would then run the following commands:

`coverage run --source=name-of-app manage.py test`

`coverage report`

To see the HTML version of the reports, and find out whether some pieces of code were missing, I ran the following commands:

`coverage html`

`python3 -m http.server`

Below are the results from the various apps on my application that I've tested:

| App | File | Coverage |
| --- | --- | --- |
| forum | forms.py | 100% |
| forum | test_forms.py | 100% |
| forum | models.py | 100% |
| forum | test_models.py | 98% |
| forum | views.py | 99% |
| forum | test_views.py | 100% |

## Bugs

It's very important to document any bugs you've discovered while developing the project.
Make sure to include any necessary steps you've implemented to fix the bug(s) as well.

For JavaScript and Python applications, it's best to screenshot the errors to include them as well.

**PRO TIP**: screenshots of bugs are extremely helpful, and go a long way!

- JS Uncaught ReferenceError: `foobar` is undefined/not defined

    ![screenshot](documentation/bug01.png)

    - To fix this, I _____________________.

- JS `'let'` or `'const'` or `'template literal syntax'` or `'arrow function syntax (=>)'` is available in ES6 (use `'esversion: 11'`) or Mozilla JS extensions (use moz).

    ![screenshot](documentation/bug02.png)

    - To fix this, I _____________________.

- Python `'ModuleNotFoundError'` when trying to import module from imported package

    ![screenshot](documentation/bug03.png)

    - To fix this, I _____________________.

- Django `TemplateDoesNotExist` at /appname/path appname/template_name.html

    ![screenshot](documentation/bug04.png)

    - To fix this, I _____________________.

- Python `E501 line too long` (93 > 79 characters)

    - To fix this, I _____________________.

### GitHub **Issues**

An improved way to manage bugs is to use the built-in **Issues** tracker on your GitHub repository.
To access your Issues, click on the "Issues" tab at the top of your repository.
Alternatively, use this link: https://github.com/cilliagustin/codepool/issues

If using the Issues tracker for your bug management, you can simplify the documentation process.
Issues allow you to directly paste screenshots into the issue without having to first save the screenshot locally,
then uploading into your project.

You can add labels to your issues (`bug`), assign yourself as the owner, and add comments/updates as you progress with fixing the issue(s).

Once you've sorted the issue, you should then "Close" it.

When showcasing your bug tracking for assessment, you can use the following format:

**Fixed Bugs**

All previously closed/fixed bugs can be tracked [here](https://github.com/cilliagustin/codepool/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aclosed).

## Unfixed Bugs

You will need to mention unfixed bugs and why they were not fixed.
This section should include shortcomings of the frameworks or technologies used.
Although time can be a big variable to consider, paucity of time and difficulty understanding
implementation is not a valid reason to leave bugs unfixed.

If you've identified any unfixed bugs, no matter how small, be sure to list them here.
It's better to be honest and list them, because if it's not documented and an assessor finds the issue,
they need to know whether or not you're aware of them as well, and why you've not corrected/fixed them.

Some examples:

- On devices smaller than 375px, the page starts to have `overflow-x` scrolling.

    ![screenshot](documentation/unfixed-bug01.png)

    - Attempted fix: I tried to add additional media queries to handle this, but things started becoming too small to read.

- For PP3, when using a helper `clear()` function, any text above the height of the terminal does not clear, and remains when you scroll up.

    ![screenshot](documentation/unfixed-bug02.png)

    - Attempted fix: I tried to adjust the terminal size, but it only resizes the actual terminal, not the allowable area for text.

- When validating HTML with a semantic `section` element, the validator warns about lacking a header `h2-h6`. This is acceptable.

    ![screenshot](documentation/unfixed-bug03.png)

    - Attempted fix: this is a known warning and acceptable, and my section doesn't require a header since it's dynamically added via JS.

If you legitimately cannot find any unfixed bugs or warnings, then use the following sentence:

There are no remaining bugs that I am aware of.
